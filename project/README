Installing Clean
================

By default the Clean system is installed in the current directory.
You can override these defaults by changing INSTALL_BIN_DIR, INSTALL_LIB_DIR, INSTALL_MAN_DIR in the Makefile.

To install the Clean system type:

	make

Using Clean
===========

Compiling Clean programs on linux can be done using one of the following tools:

- clm: A build tool for simple projects. All compilation options and paths to libraries are specified as command line arguments

- cpm: A build tool that allows you to specify build configurations of programs in Clean project files (.prj).
       You can use cpm to create or edit project files and build those projects.

  cpm relies on the environment variable `CLEAN_HOME` to point to where you installed Clean to find libraries and executables.
  So for example if you have installed clean in '/Users/myusername/clean' you should add the following exports to your .bashrc/.profile/etc

  export CLEAN_HOME=/Users/myusername/clean
  export PATH=$PATH:$CLEAN_HOME/bin

Dependencies
============

Clean uses the linker and assembler from Apple. These are not
installed by default. Therefore first Apple's XCode must be installed.
For more information on XCode see:
https://developer.apple.com/xcode/

Compiling the example programs
==============================

The directory 'examples/SmallExamples' contains small Clean programs.
The directory contains a Makefile to compile the examples.
