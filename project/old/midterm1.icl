//Students’ regulation of Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE Regulations Vol. II. 74/C.) 
//states that as long as a student presents another student’s work - 
//or at least the significant part of it - as his/her own performance, it will count as a disciplinary fault. 
//The most serious consequence of a disciplinary fault can be dismissal of the student from the University.



/*1. List ends
 Given a list of lists, append to the end of every sublist 
 the sum and the length of the sublist
*/

//append :: [[Int]] -> [[Int]]

//Start = append [[1..5],[1..4],[],[5,6]]  // [[1,2,3,4,5,15,5],[1,2,3,4,10,4],[0,0],[5,6,11,2]]

/* 2. Fractions
 
 Given a list of real numbers, keep only the fraction part of the number
*/

/*3. Famous nums

 Given a list of integers, write a function which gets rid of the numbers that is occurring
 less than 5 times in the list.
*/

//famousNum :: [Int] -> [Int]

//Start = famousNum [1,1,1,1,1,1,2,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5] // [1,1,1,1,1,1,5,5,5,5,5]

/*4. Search
 
 Implement a search algorithm that searches through a list for Int n and returns the value in the list before n. 
 If there is no value, or the list is empty, return -1. e.g., findPrev 5 [1,2,3,4,5,6] should return 4, 
 while findPrev 5 [0, 10, 20, 30] returns -1.
*/

//findPrev :: Int [Int] -> Int

//Start = findPrev 1 [1,2,3,4,5,6] // -1
//Start = findPrev 1 [] // -1 

 

/* 5. Symmetric difference 

 Given two lists of integer numbers , return a sorted list containing the symmetric difference of the two lists; 
 The symmetric difference of two lists A and B is the list (A – B) U (B – A); 
 where A - B is The difference of two lists  defined as follows:  
 The List A-B consists of elements that are in A but not in B.
 And (U) the union of two lists is a list containing all the elements of A and B without duplicates 
*/

 

//Start = symmetricDif  [1,2,3,4,5] [2,4,6] //  [1,3,5,6]

//Start = symmetricDif  [1..5] [] // [1,2,3,4,5]



/*6. Not N

 Given a list of integers and an integer N, 
 eliminate from the list elements that are positioned before N in the list and are not equal to N,
 then compute the biquadrate of the numbers left in the list.
*/

//notN :: Int [Int] -> [Int]

//Start = notN 3 [1..5] // [1,16]

/* 7.  Gap2 continued 

 Given a list of numbers, return True if the  
 the difference between two consecutive elements is always 2
 otherwise return False

//gap2C :: [Int] -> Bool

//Start = gap2C [1,3,5,7] // True

//Start = gap2C [1,5,8] // False
//Start = gap2C [] // False




/* 8. Good Lists
 Given the list of lists and a list of unique numbers. 
 Numbers that are given in this second unique number list are considered to be good numbers. 
 A List is considered good if at least half of its numbers are good. Count how many good lists 
 are in the given list of lists.

 Ex. If you are given [[1,2,3], [1,3,3,4,9,6], [3..6]]  and [1,2,3], good numbers are 1, 2 and 3. 
 First list [1,2,3] has 3 good numbers out of total 3 numbers, hence it is good. 
 Next one [1,3,3,4,9,6] has 3 good numbers (1,3,3) which is half of total length, hence it is a good one as well.
 Last list [3..6] has only one good number and is not a good list. Therefore, answer for this example is 2.
*/

//goodLists :: [[Int]] [Int] -> Int

// Start = goodLists [[1,2,3], [1..6], [3..6]] [1,2,3] // 2
// Start = goodLists [[1], [1..6], [3,8,5]] [1,2,3,8] // 3
// Start = goodLists [[], [3,2,5], [1,1,2,2]] [1] // 2
// Start = goodLists [] [1,2,3] // 0


/*9. CoPrimes
 Given 2 numbers, check if they are co-prime.
 Numbers are called co-prime if they do not have
 common divisor.
*/
//coPrimes :: Int Int -> Bool

// Start = coPrimes 12 9 // False
// Start = coPrimes 12 12 // False
// Start = coPrimes 12 13 // True
// Start = coPrimes 5 7 // True


/* 10. Clean Sequence
 The Clean sequence is defined in following way:
 s(0) = a
 s(1) = b
 s(2) = c
 and for every k greater than 2:
 s(k) = ( s(k-1)*s(k-2) + s(k-3) ) rem 1000
 
 Given n, a, b and c - generate first n numbers from Clean sequence.
*/



//clean :: Int Int Int Int -> [Int] 

// Start = clean 5 1 2 3 // [1,2,3,5,11]
// Start = clean 11 123 79 3 // [123,79,3,720,957,117,157,126,495,277,647]
// Start = clean 2 1 2 3 // [1,2]
// Start = clean 1 1 2 3 // [1]
